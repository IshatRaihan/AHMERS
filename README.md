AHMERS, active heath monitoring and emergency response system, is a mobile application-based system that wirelessly connects to a smart watch to constantly monitor the human body and respond to sudden changes in data in the case of an emergency.

People around the world are dying due to lack of security, monitoring and due to negligence of other people. For example, if you see someone lying on the ground on a narrow street on a dark night, would you approach that person to help? Or would you run away thinking it’s a trap? It’s quite an obvious answer, right? Suppose you live alone in an apartment and suddenly have a heart attack. Would you have the strength to call for help? Walking down the street alone at night? Feeling unsafe or is someone following you? Well this is where AHMERS springs into action!

Our smartwatch monitors heartbeat and body temperature, compares them with pre-set normal values and feeds those data to the app. The app and watch display those data and when the data deviate from normal values, the app immediately ask the person if he is ok. If the person fails to respond within 5 seconds, the app sends out a distress signal to our central help line along with his latitude, longitude, height and current location so that help can reach the person quickly. The app also stores the data so that medical personnel can review them later if needed to be. The user can also send out a distress message manually by pressing a dedicated button whenever needed.

In conclusion, we believe our system would be able to save hundreds of lives in a world filled with all kinds of insecurities. To us, every life matter!
